Ib. Myofascial pain with limited opening: Myofascial pain as de\ufb01ned in Ia; Pain-free unassisted mandibular opening 40mm; Maximum assisted opening (passive stretch) 5mm greater than pain-free unassisted opening. Group II: disc displacements IIa. Disc displacement with reduction: Reciprocal clicking in TMJ (click on both vertical opening and closing that occurs at point 5mm greater interincisal distance on opening than closing and is eliminated on protrusive opening), reproducible on 2 out of 3 consecutive trials; or Clicking in TMJ on both vertical range of motion (either opening or closing), reproducible on 2 out of 3 consecutive trials, and click during lateral excursion or protrusion, reproducible on 2 out of 3 consecutive trials. IIb. Disc displacement without reduction with limited opening: History of signi\ufb01cant limitation in opening; Maximum unassisted opening 35mm; Passive stretch increases opening by 4mm over maximum unassisted opening; Contralateral excursion 7mm and/or uncorrected deviation to ipsilateral side on opening; Absence of joint sound or presence of joint sounds not meeting criteria for disc displacement with reduction.

Disc displacement without reduction, without limited opening: History of signi\ufb01cant limitation of mandibular opening; Maximum unassisted opening 35mm; Passive stretch increases opening by 5mm over maximum unassisted opening; Contralateral excursion 7mm; Presence of joint sounds not meeting criteria for disc displacement with reduction; In those studies allowing images, imaging conducted by either arthrography or magnetic resonance reveals disc displacement without reduction. Group III: arthralgia, osteoarthritis, osteoarthrosis IIIa. Arthralgia: Pain in one or both joint sites (lateral pole and/or posterior attachment) during palpation; One or more of the following self-reports of pain: pain in the region of the joint, pain in the joint during maximum unassisted opening, pain in the joint during assisted opening, and pain in the joint during lateral excursion; For a diagnoses of simple arthralgia, coarse crepitus must be absent.

As an example, a 5/1 ARM means that the initial interest rate applies for five years (or 60 months, in terms of payments), after which the interest rate is adjusted annually.
